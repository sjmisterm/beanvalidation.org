== Problem

1. Java 8 comes with a whole new set of date/time related types, located in the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/time/package-summary.html[java.time] package. Those should be supported with `@Past` and `@Future`.
1. The time and time zone to compare to during validation are currently fixed to the JVM's (default) values. This should be made more flexible, so validation can be done for another time and/or time zone than the JVM's values.
Use cases: use a different time for testing, obtain the TZ from the currently logged in user, use the logical time of a batch job

== Proposition

=== Mandate `@Past`/`@Future` support for `TemporalAccessors`

JSR-310 design intentionally encouraged end users to choose concrete types for every day programming, but ensured there were  interfaces and classes that allowed third-party implementations to be  treated as first-class citizens within the framework. Building on that premise and the different use cases that lead to the creation of the several `java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor` implementations in Java SE itself (and some in related projects such as https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten-extra[ThreeTen-Extra]), basic support should be designed around the following requirements for the type:

* It implements `java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor`
* It implements `java.lang.Comparable` using a parameter `T` for which the type is assignable
* It has a static method called `now` with a sole parameter whose type is `java.time.Clock`

So, for any type `TA` that matches the above rules, `@Past` can be validated with code similar to:

    //ClockProvider is documented below
    Clock clock = clockProvider.getClock();
    //TA is TemporalAccessor & Comparable
    //Code for obtaining now static factory omitted
    TA now = now.invoke(clock);
    return t.compareTo(now) < 0;

This set of requirements makes the following Java SE types supported:

* Specific points in the timeline: `java.time.Instant`, `java.time.OffsetDateTime`, `java.time.ZonedDateTime`
* Wall-clock-like types: `java.time.LocalDate`, `java.time.LocalDateTime`, `java.time.LocalTime`
* Other partial types: `java.time.MonthDay`, `java.time.OffsetTime`, `java.time.Year`, `java.time.YearMonth`
* Non-ISO calendar types: `java.time.chrono.HirajDate`, `java.time.chrono.JapaneseDate`, `java.time.chrono.MinguoDate`, `java.time.chrono.ThaiBuddhistDate`

These rules would make the following Threeten-Extra types supported:

* Partial types: `org.threeten.extra.DayOfMonth`, `org.threeten.extra.DayOfYear`, `org.threeten.extra.YearWeek`, `org.threeten.extra.YearQuarter`

==== Working around limitations in `ConstraintValidator` that prevent the above strategy

=== Make current instant customizable

To make the current instant customizable, a new SPI which returns `java.time.Clock` to be used by the validation engine for validating `@Past` and `@Future` constraints should be added:

    package javax.validation.spi;
        
    import java.time.Clock;
        
    public interface ClockProvider {
        Clock getClock();
    }

BV implementations must use a default `ClockProvider` which always returns `java.time.Clock.systemDefault()`.

When bootstrapping a validator factory or validator, an alternative clock provider can be passed

* via `Configuration` (also exposes the default clock provider)
* via `ValidatorContext`
* using XML

E.g.

    Validator validator = Validation.byDefaultProvider()
        .configure()
        .clockProvider( myClockProvider() )
        .buildValidatorFactory()
        .getValidator();

Similar to message interpolators etc., custom clock providers are CDI-enabled if CDI is present, allowing to inject needed contextual information such as the current requests locale.

=== Extending `@Past`/`@Future` to support `nowIsValid`

In many valid use cases, these constraints should consider the current date/time, called now in JSR-310, as valid, especially when it comes to `@Future`. Therefore, both annotations should be changed to include a new attribute, `nowIsValid` (maybe `nowAsValid`), whose default is `false` in order to maintain backwards compatibility.

If the attribute is `true`, a return equals to `0` from `compareTo` will cause the constraint to be considered satisfied.

=== "Simple" `TemporalAmount` implementations support

=== `Duration` support

=== `Period` support

== Questions

1. Proposal 2. assumes that the current time + TZ can be obtained in a rather global fashion, i.e. the logical time of a currently running batch job or the TZ from the currently logged in user's profile etc.
Is there need to make this more contextual, i.e. expose the validated bean or similar? I can't see a use case for this atm.
1. One of the most common scenarios with date/time types (applies to ranges of all types though) is to have a start and end property for which start must be (sometimes equal or) greater than now and end must be (sometimes equal or) greater than start. Are we not supporting this somehow?
